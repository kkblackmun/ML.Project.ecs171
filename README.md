## ABSTRACT

Our group project aims to generate a Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) that will classify .jpg input images of dogs into one of 70 breeds. Through supervised training of the model, we hope to generate a CNN that is capable of classifying a large variety of breeds to help dog owners identify the breed of their canine. 

Our data is extracted from a Kaggle dataset containing 7946 train, 700 validation, 700 test, images (of 224X224 RGB jpg format): each dog breed contains at least 78 image examples. 

The neural net will utilize a convolutional layer and hidden layer(s) to intake a .jpg image as input and output a breed class for the image (American Spaniel, Afghan, Bloodhound, etc.).
